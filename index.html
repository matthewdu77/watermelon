<p>Watermelon is a concurrent, lock-free implementation of unordered associative arrays in C++. Watermelon supports all the same operations as <code>std::unordered_map</code>, making it an easy drop-in replacement when parallelizing single-threaded code.</p>

<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Associative arrays, more commonly referred to as dictionaries, are a vital part of modern software systems. Generally, associative arrays support insert, delete, and lookup operations. In C++, associative arrays also support iteration, along with assignment, equality, and swap operations. However, the default implementation of C++ associative arrays is not thread-safe, and so requires external locking to be used in multi-threaded programs.</p>

<p>As computers continue to be built with more processors, and more cores per processors, performant concurrent data structures are becoming increasingly necessary. By using common atomic primitives such as compare-and-swap and atomic arithmetic instead of locks, Watermelon will provide a performant, non-blocking implementation of a hash table, and use the hash table to implement associative arrays.</p>

<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>

<p>This project will likely run into difficulties with some of the additional requirements imposed by the language of implementation. <code>std::unordered_map</code> in C++ requires the implementation of equality and swap operations, along with a copy constructor. Further, the proposed hash table implementation will require dynamic resizing. These operations will all require synchronizing operations over the entire hash table. Implementing this in a lock-free manner is likely to be difficult.</p>
